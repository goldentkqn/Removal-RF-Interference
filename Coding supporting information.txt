Dear user,

Note: data should be converted to file.csv

- In the Denoising_using_wavelet_base_method(), it has two parameter need to carefully are j and n. Because in mass spectra using a frequency-scan there will be a lot of sinusoidal interference from ions trap come to detector, therefore to use j and n, user need to know exactly the existence of noise components in spectra.

- In the top_hat_baseline(), w is width of peak and it's depend on your data mean high mass or low mass. If your data is low mass but use w to large it make your plot not change anything. But vice versa, your spectra will be distorted.

- The runtime algorithm depend on CPU's computer and length of data.

Thank you!

Best regards,
Đặng Công Minh (Harley).
